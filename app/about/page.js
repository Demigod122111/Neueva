          Hi, I'm Simon, a solo developer passionate about creating software, games, and web applications. I enjoy exploring different technologies and building projects that challenge my skills and creativity.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As a developer, I focus on creating simple, efficient solutions. Whether it's a game, a tool, or a website, my goal is to make something that works well and provides value.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Most of my projects are personal, and I like to dive deep into every aspectâ€”from coding to design, testing, and deployment. Working on all parts of a project allows me to learn and grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When I'm not coding, you can find me learning new technologies, working on personal projects, or enjoying hobbies like gaming and exploring new tech trends.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Feel free to check out my work, and if you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out!
